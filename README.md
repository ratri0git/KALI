# KALI: Cybersecurity Learning Hub

## About
Welcome! This is a dynamic collection of my progress in mastering tools and systems, starting with Linux fundamentals in the `GNULINUX` folder. As a beginner, I'm building a strong foundation in ethical hacking and system security, continuously adding new tools, techniques, and projects as I learn.

## Structure
- **GNULINUX/**: Linux learning hub for system administration and cybersecurity skills.
  - **Tutor/**: Notes on Linux concepts (e.g., file systems, permissions, networking, automation, grep, awk).
  - **Exercise/**: Hands-on tasks (basic, intermediate, advanced command-line exercises).

## What I’ve Learned
- **Linux Fundamentals** (in `GNULINUX/`):
  - **Core**: File hierarchy, processes, user management, permissions.
  - **Tools**: Shell scripting, text processing (grep, awk, sed), file searching (find, locate), I/O redirection.
  - **Administration**: Package management, services, firewalls, process monitoring.
  - **Networking & Security**: SSH, network troubleshooting, Postfix email setup.
  - **Automation**: Cron jobs, shell scripting, wildcard patterns.
